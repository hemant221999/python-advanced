    "#Q1. Describe three applications for exception processing.\n",
    "Exception processing, also known as error handling, is a crucial aspect of programming that allows for the detection and management of exceptional conditions or errors that may occur during the execution of a program. Here are three common applications for exception processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Reporting and Logging:\n",
    "Exception processing provides a mechanism to capture and report errors or exceptional conditions that occur during program execution. When an error is encountered, an exception is raised, and this exception can be caught and logged with relevant details such as the error message, stack trace, timestamp, and other contextual information. Logging exceptions helps in debugging and diagnosing issues, as it provides a record of the errors that occurred during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graceful Error Handling and Recovery:\n",
    "Exception processing enables developers to gracefully handle errors and recover from exceptional conditions. Instead of abrupt termination of the program, exceptions can be caught, and appropriate actions can be taken to handle the error situation. This can include displaying informative error messages to users, retrying the operation, rolling back transactions, closing resources, or executing alternative code paths. Graceful error handling improves the user experience and helps maintain the stability and reliability of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust Input Validation:\n",
    "Exception processing is often used for input validation and error checking to ensure that data provided to the program meets the expected criteria. By validating inputs and catching exceptions, developers can handle cases where data is malformed, out of range, or violates constraints. For example, if a program expects a numeric input, an exception can be raised and caught when a non-numeric value is provided. By validating inputs and handling exceptions, the program can guide users to provide valid data and prevent crashes or unexpected behavior due to invalid inputs.\n",
    "#Q2. What happens if you don&#39;t do something extra to treat an exception?\n",
    "If an exception is not handled or treated in any way, it will propagate up the call stack until it reaches the top-level of the program. If no exception handling mechanism is in place, the program will terminate abruptly, and an error message or traceback will be displayed to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an unhandled exception occurs, the program's normal flow is interrupted, and the control is transferred to the nearest exception handler capable of handling that specific type of exception. If no suitable handler is found, the program terminates and the exception is considered unhandled.\n",
    "#Q3. What are your options for recovering from an exception in your script?\n",
    "When an exception occurs in a script, you have several options for recovering from it. The appropriate approach depends on the nature of the exception and the specific requirements of your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Handling with try-except:\n",
    "You can use a try-except block to catch and handle specific exceptions. By wrapping the code that may raise an exception in a try block, you can specify one or more except blocks to handle specific exception types. Inside the except block, you can include the recovery logic to handle the exception gracefully. This allows you to control the flow of the program even when exceptions occur.\n",
    "Exception Handling with try-except-else:\n",
    "In addition to the try-except block, you can also include an else block. The code inside the else block is executed only if no exception occurs in the try block. This can be useful when you have recovery code that should run only when no exception occurs\n",
    "Exception Handling with try-except-finally:\n",
    "You can further extend the try-except block by adding a finally block. The code inside the finally block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is commonly used to perform cleanup tasks or release resources that need to be executed regardless of exceptions.\n",
    "#Q4. Describe two methods for triggering exceptions in your script.\n",
    "Explicitly Raising Exceptions:\n",
    "You can explicitly raise an exception using the raise statement. This allows you to raise exceptions at specific points in your code to indicate exceptional conditions or errors. The raise statement is The atexit Module:followed by an instance of an exception class or an exception object.\n",
    "Letting Built-in Operations Raise Exceptions:\n",
    "Exceptions can also be triggered implicitly by built-in operations or functions when certain conditions are not met.\n",
    "#Q5. Identify two methods for specifying actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of\n",
    "whether or not an exception exists.\n",
    "The finally Block:\n",
    "The finally block is used in conjunction with the try-except block to define a set of statements that will be executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. The code inside the finally block is guaranteed to be executed before the program exits, ensuring that certain cleanup or finalization tasks are performed.\n",
    "The atexit module provides a way to register functions or methods that will be called when the Python interpreter terminates, whether by normal program termination or by an unhandled exception. The registered functions are executed in the reverse order of their registration."
